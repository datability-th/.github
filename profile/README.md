# Welcome to Datability! 🫠

We're a small but growing team based in Pathum Thani, Thailand 🇹🇭. We share the love of learning new things 🤔 as well as striving to better ourselves 😗. Our goal 🚩 is to extract the most value out of neglected data. So we make it visual 📊, fun 🎼, and insightful 💡. Although there is a lot of hype around AI and big data, the more important question - for us - is where and how do we apply AI most effectively 🤖. Can AI aid or completely replace some of our value creation process?
